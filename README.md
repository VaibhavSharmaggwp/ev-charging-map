# ev-charging-map
This project visualizes electric vehicle (EV) charging station locations using Python. It leverages the Folium library and FastMarkerCluster to efficiently map charging points on an interactive map. The notebook demonstrates geospatial data handling, clustering for performance, and simple visualization of EV infrastructure across a city or region.
